# ðŸ§  ORIGINALITY SENTINEL

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

This Python-based Plagiarism Checker is a powerful tool designed to detect and prevent academic or content-related plagiarism. Leveraging natural language processing techniques and text analysis, the system compares input text against a vast database of sources, highlighting similarities and potential instances of plagiarism. It provides detailed reports, indicating the percentage of similarity and the sources that match the input text. The tool is user-friendly and helps maintain academic integrity and originality.
